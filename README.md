## CPSC 304 Group 20

The domain of our proposed application is Pokémon management. This domain mainly pertains to main-series Pokémon game playthroughs. Specifically, when a user is playing a Pokémon game, they might desire to track the traits and details of their currently caught Pokémon, as well as search what other Pokémon are available to them based on their current in-game progress. In essence, our application aims to serve as a thorough Pokédex and encyclopedia for a user's playthrough.
